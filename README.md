# Portfolio
First version of a professional portfolio.
In this initial version , I included my photograph and resume.
I included links to every section of my portfolio by clicking the correspondent word in the header.
I included an excerpt of my background in the section about me.
The first image in the work section is bigger and it links to the github pages of my first project with the title "horiseon" that was completed at my Rice tech boot camp. This project was a refactor to improve accesibility.
I also included tiles with place holders for my future projects. I just need to add the url addresses to my CSS file. I included an "href" command for this purpose.
My contact information is provided.
I tried my webpage, and it deploys well.
