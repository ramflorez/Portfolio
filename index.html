        <p>
          As a former Environmental Investigator at the TCEQ. I served as the  manager of several databases like Central registry, CCEDS, P.A.R.I.S. and the PST program Access database. I conducted investigations to prevent, detect and remediate releases in petroleum storage tanks (PSTs) as per chapter 334 of the 30 TAC.  In addition, I conducted investigations on Stage II Vapor Recovery systems in prevention of fugitive emissions and enforcement of decommissioning rules on chapter 115 of the 30 TAC in PST facilities. Concurrently, I conducted investigations of compliance in public water supply systems (PWSs) according to chapter 290 of the 30 TAC. This position included also investigating complaints, technical reporting, interacting with contractors and providing technical assistance to the public. I took intensive training at the TCEQ including the 40 hours OSHA certification, and the Tier II chemical reporting-Right to know training.

          I have a U.S. masterâ€™s in Environmental Sciences with a GPA of 3.9. As part of this formation, I attained expert level at MS Office and Google Suites by collecting and analyzing data from assessments in wetlands and presenting this information to the scientists and engineers of the ENSC team. I have a very good working knowledge of GPS and wetlands assessments. In addition, I am a US citizen, but also eligible to work in several countries in Latin America.
